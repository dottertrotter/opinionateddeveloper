[Build it, then build it again](/post/build_it)
====================

I have spent most of my career working for startups and small companies, working mostly on green field or near green field applications. Many of them I would consider small applications but some of them had fairly large feature sets and the common thing among each one is they were all wrong. At least at some point during development there were.

One problem with building software is there is typically a lack of understanding of what is actually needed. Sure, we do Agile development and MVP's and blah blah blah. But I have yet to ever get a product I've been working on right the first time. And that's OK, or at least it should be. I've always considered software development more art than science. I think it parallels better. It's rare that a developer will build the same project or module, feature etc time after time. Most solutions are unique. We don't actually know how things are going to work out until we build them. This is partly why we develop in iterations.

I've often thought the best way to build a product is to take a few months and build the first version. Then, start over and build it again, from scratch, using everything you've learned from all of the mistakes the first time. I'm not sure many companies would go for this strategy but I think it's worth considering.
